# Tribe Wrapper - Extends tribe CLI with custom commands
#
# This wrapper intercepts custom commands and routes them to our handlers,
# while passing all other commands to the real tribe CLI.
#
# Custom commands:
#   logs  - View interaction logs between User, ClawdBot, and agents
#   auth  - OAuth authentication for tribecode.ai
#   sync  - Sync sessions with tutor.tribecode.ai (coming soon)
